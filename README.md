# Real-Time-Honda-Car-Color-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
This project implements a real-time computer vision system to detect Honda cars and identify their color using OpenCV. It processes video or image input, extracts the car region, analyzes color in HSV space, and displays the detected car color, demonstrating practical vehicle analysis using image processing.
