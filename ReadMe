This project is a real-time computer vision application that detects Honda cars and identifies their color using image processing techniques. It processes video or image input, extracts the car region, and determines the dominant color using the HSV color space.

->Features:

Real-time car color detection

Focused on Honda vehicles

Uses OpenCV for image processing

HSV-based color analysis for accuracy

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

->Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

->How It Works:

Captures frames from a video or camera feed

Detects the car region

Converts the image to HSV color space

Identifies the dominant color

Displays the detected color in real time

->How to Run:

Clone the repository

Open the Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells in
Computer_Vision_Project_Real_Time_Honda_Car_Color_Detection.ipynb

->Applications:

Traffic surveillance

Vehicle identification

Smart parking systems

Computer vision learning projects

->Future Improvements:

Support for multiple car brands

Deep learning–based detection

Improved color classification
